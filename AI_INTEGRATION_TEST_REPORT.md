## 1. HybridAIService Tests ✅

**File:** `src/services/__tests__/HybridAIService.test.ts`

### Test Coverage
- **Service Initialization:** Validates all AI services (Claude, Gemini Local, Gemini Cloud, DeepSeek) are properly initialized
- **Fallback Chain Logic:** Tests sequential fallback from Claude → Gemini Local → Gemini Cloud → DeepSeek → Offline
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Validates circuit breaker implementation for failed services
- **Health Monitoring:** Tests health checks, quality scoring, and service status tracking
- **Memory Management:** Ensures proper cleanup and resource management

### Key Test Scenarios
```typescript
✅ Should initialize with all AI services
✅ Should handle fallback chain correctly
✅ Should implement circuit breaker for failed services
✅ Should provide comprehensive health monitoring
✅ Should clean up resources properly
```

### Implementation Status
**READY** - Tests are comprehensive and cover all critical functionality for the hybrid AI service architecture.

## 2. Natural Language Command Parser Tests ⚠️

**File:** `src/services/__tests__/NaturalLanguageCommandParser.test.ts`

### Test Coverage
- **Command Recognition:** 12 different fantasy football command types
- **Entity Extraction:** Players, positions, timeframes, actions, league references
- **Context Enhancement:** Conversation history, league awareness, ambiguity detection
- **Confidence Scoring:** Pattern matching confidence and quality assessment
- **Gemini Integration:** Fallback to pattern matching when AI unavailable

### Test Results Analysis
```typescript
❌ Command recognition needs pattern refinement (failing on 5/6 command types)
❌ Entity extraction missing implementation (timeframe, actions, positions)
✅ Player name extraction working correctly
✅ Context management and inheritance working
✅ Confidence scoring logic present but needs tuning
```

### Issues Identified
1. **Pattern Matching:** Current regex patterns not matching test queries effectively
2. **Entity Extraction:** Core extraction methods need implementation completion
3. **Confidence Scoring:** Scoring algorithm producing higher scores than expected

### Recommendations
- Refine regex patterns in `COMMAND_INTENTS` array
- Implement missing entity extraction methods
- Adjust confidence scoring thresholds
- Add more training data for pattern recognition

## 3. AIEnhancedChatPanel Component Tests ⚠️

**File:** `src/components/__tests__/AIEnhancedChatPanel.test.tsx`

### Test Coverage
- **Component Rendering:** Header, messages, input controls, league switcher
- **Message Display:** User vs AI message styling, metadata display, cross-league insights
- **Input Handling:** Text input, send actions, keyboard shortcuts, validation
- **Performance Features:** Virtualized scrolling, memory management, message limits
- **Error Handling:** Network failures, service errors, graceful degradation

### Test Results Analysis
```typescript
✅ Basic component rendering working
✅ Message display and metadata handling
⚠️ Input interaction tests failing due to component structure differences
⚠️ Button accessibility issues in test environment
✅ Performance optimization tests passing
✅ Error handling scenarios covered
```

### Issues Identified
1. **Component Structure:** Test expectations don't match actual component DOM structure
2. **Event Handling:** Send button events not properly bound in test environment
3. **Accessibility:** Button labeling inconsistencies

### Recommendations
- Update test selectors to match actual component implementation
- Fix button event binding and accessibility labels
- Align test expectations with component API
