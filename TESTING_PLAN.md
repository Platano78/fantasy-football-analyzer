# üß™ Fantasy Football Analyzer Testing Plan

## Phase 1: Live Data Integration Testing

### Browser MCP Data Collection Test
**Target Sites for Live Data**:
1. **FantasyPros** - Player rankings and ADP data
2. **NFL.com** - Injury reports and player news  
3. **ESPN Fantasy** - Updated projections

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to FantasyPros 2025 rankings
2. Extract top 200 players with: Name, Position, Team, ADP, Projections
3. Navigate to injury reports for health status
4. Integrate with existing mock data structure

**Expected Results**:
- Live Data tab shows "200+ players" instead of current 19
- Real ADP updates in player cards
- Current injury status reflected
- "Update All Data" button actually fetches new data

## Phase 2: Draft Tracker Testing

### Mock Draft Simulation
**Test Approach**: Create simulated draft environment
1. Set up timer system (60 seconds per pick)
2. Simulate other teams drafting (auto-draft simulation)
3. Test "Connect to Draft Room" functionality
4. Test screenshot automation

**Expected Results**:
- Live countdown timer during draft
- Draft progress tracking
- Screenshot capture of draft state
- Integration with Browser MCP for draft room monitoring
